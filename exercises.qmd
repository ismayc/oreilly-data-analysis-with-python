# Intro: Foundations of Data Analysis with Python

## Walkthrough #1: Setting Up the Python Environment

If you haven't already installed Python, Jupyter, and the necessary packages, there are instructions on the course repo in the README to do so [here](https://github.com/ismayc/oreilly-data-analysis-with-python/blob/main/README.md). 

If you aren't able to do this on your machine, you may want to check out [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). It's a free service that allows you to run Jupyter notebooks in the cloud.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import plotly.express as px
```

## Exercise #1: Setting Up the Python Environment

Follow the instructions above to check for correct installation of necessary
packages. We'll wait a few minutes to make sure as many of you are set up as
possible. Please give a thumbs up in the pulse check if you are ready to move on.
