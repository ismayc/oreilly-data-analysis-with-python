# Intro: Foundations of Data Analysis with Python

## Walkthrough #1: Setting Up the Python Environment

If you haven't already installed Python, Jupyter, and the necessary packages, there are instructions on the course repo in the README to do so [here](https://github.com/ismayc/oreilly-data-analysis-with-python/blob/main/README.md). 

If you aren't able to do this on your machine, you may want to check out [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). It's a free service that allows you to run Jupyter notebooks in the cloud.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import plotly.express as px
```

## Exercise #1: Setting Up the Python Environment

By completing this exercise, you will be able to  
- Import necessary Python packages  
- Check for successful package loading  


Follow the instructions above in Walkthrough #1 to check for correct installation 
of necessary packages. We'll wait a few minutes to make sure as many of you are
set up as possible. Please give a thumbs up in the pulse check if you are ready
to move on.

# Module 4: Real-World Data Analysis Project

## Walkthrough #9: Interactive Charts and Dashboards with Plotly

### Selecting a Dataset

#### Questions to Ask:
1. **What industry problem or area of interest does the dataset align with?**
   - Is the dataset relevant to economic analysis, market research, policy planning, or another industry?
2. **Does the dataset provide sufficient complexity and scope for a thorough analysis?**
   - Does it include multiple variables and data points across different time periods and categories (e.g., income groups, countries)?
3. **What specific questions or hypotheses do we want to explore with this dataset?**
   - Are we interested in comparing economic indicators across countries, understanding the impact of GDP per capita on other variables, or identifying trends over time?

#### Example:
- **Dataset**: The `economies` dataset.
- **Industry Problem**: Understanding economic disparities between countries and the impact of economic indicators on overall economic health.
- **Specific Questions**:
  - How do GDP per capita and gross savings vary across different income groups?
  - How has the inflation rate changed over time for specified income groups?

### Applying Cleaning, Transforming, and Analysis Techniques

#### Questions to Ask:
1. **What cleaning steps are necessary to prepare the data for analysis?**
   - Are there any missing values that need to be handled? Are there any inconsistencies in data types?
2. **What transformations are required to make the data analysis-ready?**
   - Do we need to create new columns, filter specific rows, or aggregate data by certain categories?
3. **How can we analyze the data to uncover patterns, trends, or anomalies?**
   - What statistical methods or visualizations can we use to explore relationships between variables?

#### Example:
- **Cleaning**:

```{python}
  # Handle missing values
  economies_cleaned = economies.fillna({
      'gdp_percapita': economies['gdp_percapita'].mean(),
      'gross_savings': economies['gross_savings'].mean(),
      'inflation_rate': economies['inflation_rate'].mean(),
      'total_investment': economies['total_investment'].mean(),
      'unemployment_rate': economies['unemployment_rate'].mean(),
      'exports': economies['exports'].mean(),
      'imports': economies['imports'].mean()
  })

  # Convert categorical variables to category type
  economies_cleaned['income_group'] = economies_cleaned['income_group'].astype('category')
  economies_cleaned
```

- **Transforming**:
  
```{python}
  # Create new columns for analysis
  economies_cleaned['gdp_growth'] = economies_cleaned.groupby('code')['gdp_percapita'].pct_change()
  economies_cleaned
```

- **Analyzing**:

```{python}
  import seaborn as sns
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  plt.clf()

  # Analyze the relationship between GDP per capita and gross savings
  sns.scatterplot(data=economies_cleaned, x='gdp_percapita', y='gross_savings', hue='income_group')
  plt.title('GDP Per Capita vs. Gross Savings by Income Group')
  plt.show()
  plt.clf()

  # Analyze the trend of inflation rate over time for all classified income groups
  classified_data = economies_cleaned[economies_cleaned['income_group'] != 'Not classified']
  sns.lineplot(data=classified_data, x='year', y='inflation_rate', 
               hue='income_group', errorbar=None)
  plt.title('Inflation Rate Over Time by Specified Income Group')
  plt.legend(title='Income Group', labels=classified_data['income_group'].unique())
  plt.show()
```

### Initial Findings and Interpretation

#### Questions to Ask:
1. **What do the initial findings tell us about the data?**
   - Are there any notable patterns or trends in the data? Are there any unexpected results?
2. **How do these insights relate to the problem defined earlier?**
   - Do the findings help us understand economic disparities between countries? Do they provide insights into the impact of certain economic indicators?
3. **What hypotheses can we test based on the initial results?**
   - Can we test hypotheses about the relationship between GDP per capita and other economic indicators? Can we refine our analysis to explore these hypotheses further?

#### Example:
- **Initial Findings**:
  - **GDP per Capita vs. Gross Savings**: The scatter plot shows that high-income countries generally have higher GDP per capita and gross savings. There seems to be a slight positive correlation between these two indicators.
  - **Inflation Rate Over Time**: The line plot indicates that inflation rates vary significantly over time and across different income groups. Low and lower middle income countries tend to experience higher volatility in inflation rates.

- **Interpretation**:
  - These findings suggest that economic health, as measured by GDP per capita and gross savings, is strongly influenced by the income group of a country. High-income countries appear to have more stable and higher economic performance.
  - The volatility in inflation rates among low-income countries may indicate economic instability, which could be a key area for policy intervention.

- **Hypotheses**:
  - **Hypothesis 1**: High-income countries have a higher average GDP per capita and gross savings compared to low-income countries.
  - **Hypothesis 2**: Low-income countries experience greater volatility in inflation rates compared to high-income countries.

- **Next Steps**:
  - Conduct further analysis to test these hypotheses, using statistical methods to confirm the observed patterns.
  - Explore other economic indicators to gain a more comprehensive understanding of economic disparities and trends.

By following these steps, you can effectively select, clean, transform, and analyze the `economies` dataset to gain valuable insights and address common industry problems or research questions.


## Walkthrough #10: Finalizing and Presenting Your Data Analysis Project

### Integrate Feedback to Refine the Analysis

#### Questions to Ask:
1. **What feedback have you received from peers, stakeholders, or mentors?**
   - Is there feedback on the clarity of the analysis, choice of visualizations, or the comprehensiveness of the analysis?
2. **How can you incorporate this feedback into your analysis?**
   - Are there additional variables that need to be analyzed? Do you need to clean the data further or adjust the visualizations?
3. **What new questions or hypotheses have emerged from the feedback?**
   - Does the feedback suggest new directions for the analysis or areas that need more focus?

#### Example:
- **Feedback**:
  - Peers suggested that the analysis should also consider the impact of unemployment rates.
  - Stakeholders requested more clarity on the relationship between GDP per capita and inflation rates across different income groups.

- **Refining the Analysis**:
  - Additional data needs to be found to meet the request for more clarity. Or maybe a further drilldown on specific countries would be helpful?
  
### Finalize the Presentation with Impactful Visuals and Narrative

#### Questions to Ask:
1. **What are the key insights from the analysis that need to be highlighted?**
   - What are the most important findings that should be communicated to the audience?
2. **How can you create impactful visuals that clearly convey these insights?**
   - What types of charts or visualizations best represent the data and findings?
3. **What narrative will you use to guide the audience through the presentation?**

#### Example:
- **Key Insights**:
  - High-income countries have higher GDP per capita and gross savings.
  - There is a positive correlation between GDP per capita and gross savings.
  - Low-income countries experience greater volatility in inflation rates.
  - Unemployment rates vary significantly across income groups.

- **Impactful Visuals**:

```{python}
  import plotly.express as px

  # Bar chart of GDP per Capita by Country and Income Group
  bar_fig = px.bar(economies_cleaned, x='code', y='gdp_percapita', color='income_group',
                   title='GDP Per Capita by Country and Income Group (2020)',
                   labels={'gdp_percapita': 'GDP Per Capita', 'code': 'Country Code'})
  bar_fig.show()

  # Scatter plot of GDP per Capita vs. Gross Savings by Income Group
  scatter_fig = px.scatter(economies_cleaned, x='gdp_percapita', y='gross_savings', color='income_group',
                           hover_name='code', title='GDP Per Capita vs. Gross Savings (2020)',
                           labels={'gdp_percapita': 'GDP Per Capita', 'gross_savings': 'Gross Savings (%)'})
  scatter_fig.show()

  # Scatter plot of GDP per Capita vs. Unemployment Rate by Income Group
  scatter_fig_2 = px.scatter(economies_cleaned, x='gdp_percapita', y='unemployment_rate', color='income_group',
                             hover_name='code', title='GDP Per Capita vs. Unemployment Rate (2020)',
                             labels={'gdp_percapita': 'GDP Per Capita', 'unemployment_rate': 'Unemployment Rate (%)'})
  scatter_fig_2.show()
```
